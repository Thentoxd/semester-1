# To test that you can successfully download a file and upload it to gradescope

# You are going to write a very simple program:

# Ask a user to enter two numbers (one per input)
num1 = input("Enter number 1: ")
if not num1.isnumeric():
    print("That is not a number")
    exit()

num2 = intput("Enter number 2: ")
if not num2.isnumeric():
    print("That is not a number")
    exit()

# multiply those numbers together
answer = int(num1) * int(num2)

# print out the result
print(answer)

# There is an extra point available for validating that they entered numbers!
# Add to your code so that if they entered something other than an integer it prints
# 'That is not a number' and exits.

# Download your file, and upload it to the 'Week 1 Session 2 - Practice Upload' task on Minerva.
# You will get some feedback - ensure you are passing the tests!
